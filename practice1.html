    <h2>biography</h2>
    <p>Linus Torvalds (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux operating system.

        At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer programming on his grandfather’s Commodore VIC-20. In 1991 while a computer science student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he purchased his first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied, however, with the computer’s operating system (OS). His PC used MS-DOS (the disk operating system from Microsoft), but Torvalds preferred the UNIX operating system he had used on the university’s computers. Consequently, he decided to create his own PC-based version of UNIX.
